Run show_cam.py file.  Or from Python environment:


>> import cv2
>> feed = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
>> feed.isOpened()
>> _, frame = feed.read()

Is feed opened?
Is frame None?	This is bad.
Is _ False?	This is bad.


Using opencv packages with pip (eg opencv-python) didn't work.
I ended up building OpenCV from source, installing into /usr/local/lib,
and then adding that path to my PYTHONPATH.  The built cv2 package then
allowed me to open my webcam.
